## üìö Model Insights

The **WhatsApp Chat Analyzer** is designed to transform raw exported `.txt` chat files into actionable insights using a combination of data preprocessing, natural language processing (NLP), and interactive visualization. Below is an in-depth overview of the analytical components and models used:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion and Preprocessing

- The input data consists of chat histories exported from WhatsApp in a standard `.txt` format.
- The parser reads each line, extracts timestamps, sender names, message content, media messages, and system notifications.
- Timestamps are converted into a structured datetime format to enable time-series analysis.
- Non-informative messages (e.g., ‚Äú<Media omitted>‚Äù, ‚ÄúMessages you send to this chat are now secured‚Ä¶‚Äù) are filtered out to ensure only meaningful conversation data is analyzed.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Tokenization and Text Cleaning

- Message text is tokenized and normalized: lowercasing, removal of stop words, punctuation, and special characters.
- For word frequency and word cloud generation, the cleaned tokens are aggregated across all messages.
- Libraries such as **NLTK** or **spaCy** are utilized for robust natural language preprocessing.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sentiment Analysis

- Sentiment analysis is performed using the **TextBlob** library (or optionally **NLTK‚Äôs VADER**) to classify each message as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.
- The sentiment polarity scores are aggregated over daily, weekly, or monthly intervals to generate trends.
- This enables users to visualize the emotional tone of conversations over time, revealing patterns such as conflict periods or highly positive interactions.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Summaries and Aggregations

- Descriptive statistics such as total messages, messages per contact, average message length, and media shares are computed.
- Grouped aggregations (e.g., by day, month, year, or sender) facilitate multi-level analysis and drill-down exploration.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization Layer

- Interactive plots are rendered using **Plotly**, ensuring responsive, high-quality charts that enhance user engagement.
- Visual components include:
  - **Activity Timeline:** Messages plotted over time with filters for granularity.
  - **Most Active Contacts:** Horizontal bar charts highlighting chat frequency by participant.
  - **Word Cloud:** Dynamic rendering of top words with size proportional to frequency.
  - **Sentiment Trends:** Line plots showing sentiment polarity fluctuations.
- All visualizations are integrated seamlessly within a **Streamlit** dashboard, providing an intuitive user experience with minimal configuration.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Privacy and Local Processing

- The entire pipeline is executed locally via Streamlit, ensuring that no chat data is ever transmitted to external servers.
- This guarantees maximum user privacy while delivering professional-grade analytics.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Benefits

- Provides multi-faceted insights into personal or group chat dynamics.
- Combines classical NLP with intuitive visual storytelling.
- Designed with modularity in mind, enabling future extension with advanced models (e.g., topic modeling or custom-trained sentiment classifiers).
